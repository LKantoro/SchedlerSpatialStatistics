	abstract = {Modeling spatial interactions that arise in spatially referenced data is commonly done by incorporating the spatial dependence into the covariance structure either explicitly or implicitly via an autoregressive model. In the case of lattice (regional summary) data, two common autoregressive models used are the conditional autoregressive model (CAR) and the simultaneously autoregressive model (SAR). Both of these models produce spatial dependence in the covariance structure as a function of a neighbor matrix W and often a fixed unknown spatial correlation parameter. This paper examines in detail the correlation structures implied by these models as applied to an irregular lattice in an attempt to demonstrate their many counterintuitive or impractical results. A data example is used for illustration where US statewide average SAT verbal scores are modeled and examined for spatial structure using different spatial models.},

	abstract = {Advances in computing technology have spurred two extraordinary phenomena in science: large-scale and high-throughput data collection coupled with the creation and implementation of complex statistical algorithms for data analysis. These two phenomena have brought about tremendous advances in scientific discovery but have raised two serious concerns. The complexity of modern data analyses raises questions about the reproducibility of the analyses, meaning the ability of independent analysts to recreate the results claimed by the original authors using the original data and analysis techniques. Reproducibility is typically thwarted by a lack of availability of the original data and computer code. A more general concern is the replicability of scientific findings, which concerns the frequency with which scientific claims are confirmed by completely independent investigations. Although reproducibility and replicability are related, they focus on different aspects of scientific progress. In this review, we discuss the origins of reproducible research, characterize the current status of reproducibility in public health research, and connect reproducibility to current concerns about the replicability of scientific findings. Finally, we describe a path forward for improving both the reproducibility and replicability of public health research in the future.},
